;90-90 solid echo sequence for wide line observation


;set d6 to 5-100usec depending on dead time
;set d7 shorter than d6 by 3usec plus 10 dw to make
;sure the evolution of the echo is obvserved, then left shift
;FID prior to ft to get smallest possible 1st order pohase correction
;set receiver phase either with phcor0 or with HPCU receiver phase
;to get maximum signal in ADC channel A and almost no signal in channel B
;for minimum 0 order phase correction (no signal in channel B  is only
;possible if O1 exactly in center and spectrum perfectly symmetric).
;phase cycle will cancel deadtime partially, but not perfectly

;set:
;d1 : recycle delay
;p1 : X 90 degree pulse
;pl1 : X power level
;d6 : echo delay
;d7 : =0, or no longer than d6-de
